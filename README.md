# .Vim configuration

README file for this repository
This repository contains the code that I use for my vim configuration

The code is organized in the following way:

- `.vimrc`: the main configuration file for vim

- `plugged/`: directory containing the plugins that I use

- `colors/`: directory containing the color schemes that I use

- `autoload/`: directory containing the scripts that I use

## Installation

To install this configuration, you need to follow these steps:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:CSantos01/vim_config.git
cd vim_config
cp .vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
Then source inside vim:
```vim
:source ~/.vimrc
```
